## Vision

Augment my campus is a project to provide QR codes with different functionality through a campus of an university. The system is designed to 
be a flexible way to disseminate information to the student body, provide location and context sensitive services for students and staff as well and 
can be used as kick start for a desired CO (student) Community.
